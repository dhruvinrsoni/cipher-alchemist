# ‚ùì Cipher Alchemist - Frequently Asked Questions

Comprehensive answers to common questions about security, usage, deployment, and accessibility.

---

## üîê Security & Privacy

### **Q: Is my data safe? Where is it processed?**
**A:** Your data is completely safe! Cipher Alchemist processes everything **locally in your browser**. No phrases, passwords, or personal data is ever sent to external servers. The app works entirely offline, ensuring your information never leaves your device.

### **Q: How secure are the generated passwords?**
**A:** Very secure! The cipher algorithm uses advanced symbolic substitution that significantly increases password entropy:
- **Character Complexity**: Simple letters become complex symbols (e.g., `m` ‚Üí `/\/\`, `n` ‚Üí `|\|`)
- **Entropy Boost**: Multi-character substitutions exponentially increase password space
- **Real-time Analysis**: Built-in strength meter evaluates cryptographic security
- **Length Scaling**: Longer phrases create exponentially stronger passwords

### **Q: Can someone reverse-engineer my password to get my phrase?**
**A:** While theoretically possible with enough time and computing power, it's practically infeasible:
- **One-way Nature**: The cipher is designed for forward transformation
- **Symbol Complexity**: Many-to-many character mappings obscure patterns
- **Length Advantage**: Longer phrases create virtually unbreakable passwords
- **Personal Phrases**: Unique personal references add unpredictability

### **Q: What if the algorithm has vulnerabilities?**
**A:** The algorithm is **open source** and available for security review:
- **Transparency**: Full code available in `js/cipher-algorithms.js`
- **Community Review**: Open for security audits and improvements
- **Deterministic**: Predictable, testable transformations
- **No Hidden Logic**: Everything is visible and verifiable

### **Q: Should I use this for banking or high-security accounts?**
**A:** Yes, but with best practices:
- **Use long, complex phrases** (12+ characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- **Combine with 2FA** for critical accounts
- **Use unique phrases** for different account categories
- **Keep phrase hints secure** (not the full phrase)

## üíª Usage & Features

### **Q: How do I create a strong phrase?**
**A:** Follow these guidelines for maximum security:

**Good Phrase Structure:**
```
Personal reference + Numbers + Symbols = Strong base
Example: "MyDog Luna2023!" ‚Üí Strong cipher password
```

**Best Practices:**
- **Personal but not obvious**: Use meaningful references others can't guess
- **Mix case and symbols**: Include uppercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Avoid dictionary words**: Use personal abbreviations or misspellings
- **Include dates/numbers**: Personal dates or meaningful numbers
- **12+ characters**: Longer phrases create exponentially stronger passwords

### **Q: How do phrase suggestions work?**
**A:** The app includes 48+ curated phrases across 12 themed categories:
- **üí™ Power & Motivation**: Inspirational phrases for personal growth
- **üèÜ Achievement & Victory**: Success-oriented phrases
- **üß† Learning & Growth**: Education and development themes
- **üíª Technology & Innovation**: Tech-focused suggestions
- **üßò Health & Vitality**: Wellness and mindfulness phrases
- **üïâÔ∏è Spiritual & Wisdom**: Philosophical and spiritual references

**Usage Tips:**
- Click any suggestion to try it instantly
- Use as inspiration for personal variations
- Combine multiple suggestions for longer phrases

### **Q: Can I save my generated passwords?**
**A:** The app doesn't store passwords for security reasons, but you can:
- **Copy to clipboard** for immediate use
- **Use a password manager** to store generated passwords
- **Remember your phrase** to regenerate the same password anytime
- **Create phrase hints** (not full phrases) for memory aids

### **Q: What's the maximum phrase length?**
**A:** There's no hard limit! However, practical considerations:
- **Sweet Spot**: 12-25 characters for optimal security/usability balance
- **Very Long Phrases**: 50+ characters create extremely strong passwords
- **Memory Limit**: Consider what you can reliably remember
- **Copy Buffer**: Very long passwords may have clipboard limitations

### **Q: Can I share specific examples with others using direct links?**
**A:** Yes! Cipher Alchemist supports URL parameters for instant phrase testing:

**Direct Link Format:**
```
https://dhruvinrsoni.github.io/cipher-alchemist/?phrase=YourPhrase
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Q: The app isn't loading properly. What should I do?**

**Common Solutions:**
1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh with `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. **Disable Extensions**: Try in incognito/private mode
3. **Update Browser**: Ensure you're using a supported browser version
4. **Check Internet**: Initial load requires internet connection

**Advanced Troubleshooting:**
```bash
# Check browser console for errors
# Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab ‚Üí Look for red error messages

# Clear all site data
# Browser Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Clear browsing data ‚Üí Select "Cipher Alchemist"
```

### **Q: Keyboard shortcuts aren't working. How do I fix this?**

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. **Page Focus**: Click somewhere on the app to ensure it has focus
2. **Extension Conflicts**: Disable browser extensions that might intercept shortcuts
3. **Operating System**: Some OS shortcuts may override app shortcuts
4. **Browser Settings**: Check if browser has disabled JavaScript

**Verification:**
- Press `Ctrl+?` to open shortcuts help
- If modal opens, shortcuts are working
- If not, try the troubleshooting steps above

### **Q: The install button doesn't appear. Why?**

**Requirements for Install Button:**
- **PWA Support**: Browser must support Progressive Web Apps
- **HTTPS**: Site must be served over secure connection
- **Not Installed**: App isn't already installed
- **Not Incognito**: Not browsing in private/incognito mode

**Alternative Installation:**
- **Chrome**: Menu ‚Üí More tools ‚Üí Create shortcut ‚Üí Check "Open as window"
- **Firefox**: Menu ‚Üí Install this site as an app
- **Safari iOS**: Share ‚Üí Add to Home Screen
- **Edge**: Menu ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Install this site as an app

### **Q: Generated passwords look weird or broken. Is this normal?**

**This is Normal!** The cipher creates intentionally complex symbols:
- `m` becomes `/\/\` (representing the letter M visually)
- `n` becomes `|\|` (representing the letter N visually)
- `w` becomes `\/\/` (representing the letter W visually)

**These complex symbols are features, not bugs:**
- **Increased Security**: Multi-character substitutions dramatically increase password entropy
- **Visual Logic**: Symbols often visually represent the original letters
- **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output
- **Copy-Paste Safe**: All symbols are standard Unicode characters
