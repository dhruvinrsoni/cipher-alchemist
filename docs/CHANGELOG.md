**Commit:** [0c3b796](https://github.com/dhruvinrsoni/cipher-alchemist/commit/0c3b796d5e3c9dc2d2db3a9e5dfae337823438de)  
**Author:** Dhruvin Soni

#### fix: Offline support for Cipher Alchemist

Enable offline support by caching essential files in the service worker.
service worker is currently caching only absolute paths (e.g., index.html, styles.css). On GitHub Pages or similar static hosts, your files are likely served from a subdirectory (e.g., /cipher-alchemist/index.html), not from the root /.

This means the service worker can't find or cache the files correctly, so offline mode fails.

How to fix:

Use relative paths (e.g., index.html, styles.css) in cache.addAll.
Or, use the correct subdirectory path (e.g., /cipher-alchemist/index.html).
update your service worker to cache the correct paths for GitHub Pages deployment.

#### fix(service-worker): implement immediate cache refresh on update

Improve the service worker to ensure new deployments are immediately
available to users by:
- Adding skipWaiting() to activate updates without delay

after new deployments until manually refreshing the page.
