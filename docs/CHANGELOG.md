#### feat: add automated CHANGELOG generation

Summary:
Enhance the version update workflow to automatically generate and commit a CHANGELOG.md file alongside version.txt on each push to main.

Changes:
- Add new step to generate CHANGELOG.md containing last 50 meaningful commits
- Update git commit process to include CHANGELOG.md in the commit
- Modify commit message to reflect both files being updated

Why:
This change improves project documentation by maintaining an auto-updated changelog, making it easier for users and contributors to track meaningful changes to the project without manual intervention.

Technical Details:
- CHANGELOG excludes version update commits to prevent noise
- Format includes commit message, hash, author, and date for comprehensive history

#### refactor: improve version display and metadata handling

This commit implements a more robust version display system with the following improvements:

- Add meta tag in HTML for version injection during build time
- Refactor version display logic to first check meta tag, then fall back to version.txt
- Split version display into separate elements for better mobile presentation
- Simplify the format in update-version.yml workflow
- Restructure footer to prioritize version information

These changes make the version display more maintainable and create a clearer
separation between version metadata and attribution. The system now handles
both build-time injection and runtime fetching, improving reliability across
deployment scenarios.

#### feat: Add version tracking system and GitHub project link

Reason:
- Implement version tracking to provide transparency about which build users are interacting with
- Improve project discoverability by adding a link to the GitHub repository

Impact:

- Users can easily navigate to the project repository

Testing:
- Verified version.txt is properly displayed in the UI
- Confirmed GitHub Actions workflow updates version correctly on push

Note:
- Initial version is set to "dev" and will be updated by the workflow
- No breaking changes or new dependencies introduced
