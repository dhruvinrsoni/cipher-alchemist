#### refactor: improve version display and metadata handling

This commit implements a more robust version display system with the following improvements:

- Add meta tag in HTML for version injection during build time
- Refactor version display logic to first check meta tag, then fall back to version.txt
- Split version display into separate elements for better mobile presentation
- Simplify the format in update-version.yml workflow
- Restructure footer to prioritize version information

These changes make the version display more maintainable and create a clearer
separation between version metadata and attribution. The system now handles
both build-time injection and runtime fetching, improving reliability across
deployment scenarios.

#### feat: Add version tracking system and GitHub project link

Reason:
- Implement version tracking to provide transparency about which build users are interacting with
- Improve project discoverability by adding a link to the GitHub repository

Impact:
- Version information now displays in the footer of the application
- Automated GitHub Action will update version.txt on each commit to main
- Users can easily navigate to the project repository

Testing:
- Verified version.txt is properly displayed in the UI
- Confirmed GitHub Actions workflow updates version correctly on push

Note:
- Initial version is set to "dev" and will be updated by the workflow
- No breaking changes or new dependencies introduced

#### fix: Offline support for Cipher Alchemist

Enable offline support by caching essential files in the service worker.
service worker is currently caching only absolute paths (e.g., index.html, styles.css). On GitHub Pages or similar static hosts, your files are likely served from a subdirectory (e.g., /cipher-alchemist/index.html), not from the root /.

This means the service worker can't find or cache the files correctly, so offline mode fails.

How to fix:

Use relative paths (e.g., index.html, styles.css) in cache.addAll.
Or, use the correct subdirectory path (e.g., /cipher-alchemist/index.html).
update your service worker to cache the correct paths for GitHub Pages deployment.

#### fix(service-worker): implement immediate cache refresh on update

Improve the service worker to ensure new deployments are immediately
available to users by:
- Adding skipWaiting() to activate updates without delay
- Implementing proper activate event handler to clear old caches
- Adding client claiming to update all open tabs

This resolves the issue where users continued seeing outdated content
after new deployments until manually refreshing the page.
