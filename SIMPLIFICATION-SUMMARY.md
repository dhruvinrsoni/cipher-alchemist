# 📋 Cipher Alchemist v1.0.0 Simplification & Release System Update

## ✅ Completed Changes (June 4, 2025)

### 🗑️ **Removed Components**
1. **Package.json** - Removed to keep project simple (HTML/CSS/JS only)

### 🔄 **Converted BAT Files** (Validation/Reporting Only)
1. **release-v1.0.0.bat** → Now provides GO/NO-GO validation reports only
2. **validate-v1.0.0.bat** → Renamed to `validate-release.bat` (generic, version-independent)
3. **quick-release.bat** → Now provides release status reports and GitHub Actions guidance

### 📝 **Updated Documentation**

3. **RELEASE-v1.0.0.md**:
   - Updated to reflect simplified v1.0.0 feature set
   - Removed advanced password analysis references
   - Updated release date to June 4, 2025

### 🕐 **IST Timezone Support**
1. **version.txt** - Updated with IST timezone format
2. **GitHub Actions** - Already had IST timezone support in rollback.yml and manual-release.yml

### 🎯 **V1.0.0 Core Features** (Finalized)
- ✅ Basic cryptographic transformations (character substitution)
- ✅ Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline support  
- ✅ Dual theme system (dark/light mode)
- ✅ Responsive design with mobile optimization
- ✅ Vedic philosophy integration with Sanskrit examples
- ✅ Collapsible UI with transformation explanations
- ✅ GitHub Actions for release management
- ❌ Advanced password strength analysis (removed from v1.0.0)
- ❌ Circular progress meters (removed from v1.0.0)
- ❌ Complex scoring algorithms (removed from v1.0.0)

### 🚀 **Release Process** (Simplified)
1. **Local Validation**: Run `validate-release.bat` for GO/NO-GO report
2. **GitHub Actions Execution**: Use "Manual Release & Tag Creation" workflow
3. **Dynamic Branch Detection**: Workflows automatically detect available branches
4. **IST Timezone**: All timestamps in Asia/Kolkata timezone
5. **Rollback Support**: Use "Rollback to Previous Version" workflow if needed
